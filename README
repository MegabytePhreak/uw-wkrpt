UW-WKRPT
--------

Thanks for downloading uw-wkrpt.  This is a LaTeX document class that I
developed to make you life easier, when writing work term reports for
the University of Waterloo.

	If you do not know LaTeX, please learn!  It is not too
difficult to use, and is really quite helpful.  You can read the
workreport-sample.pdf file included in this tarball, as well as
the following two books:

A simplified introduction to LaTeX
  http://carbon.cuderwer.edu/~hgreenbe/aboutme/simplified-intro.html

A not so short introduction to LaTeX2e: or LaTeX2e in 113 minutes
  http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/lshort/

	You can also find more information on-line.  There is a FAQ
at: http://faq.tug.org and an page listing documentation for beginners
at: http://www.tug.org/begin.html

	Please send me any comments, bug reports, bug fixes and 
suggestions that you may have.  You can get the newest copy of this
document class from my school-hosted website at:
  http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~sfllaw/programs/uw-wkrpt/

simpler, and your work report nicer.  After the ``\documentclass{uw-wkrpt}''
line, just add ``\usepackage{foo}'', where ``foo'' is the package name.

* acronym
    for spelling out acronyms in full, the first time only.

* longtable
    for tabular environments that break pages.

* tabularx
    for tabular environments that know how wide they are.

* ltxtable
    for a merge of longtable and tabularx, which may not work.
