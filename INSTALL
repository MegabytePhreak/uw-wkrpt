INSTALLATION
------------

uw-wkrpt now has an installation system.  If you are on a Unix-like
system, and have a complete TeX system, find where your texmf root is.
This should typically be /usr/share/texmf which implies that installing
is as easy as running:

    # make DESTDIR=/usr/share install

	I have no idea how this will work on a Windows system.  I guess
the best thing you can do is to extract the installer file, and then
move things about.

    > latex uw-wkrpt.ins

I will ship pre-compiled PDF files for all the examples, in the hopes
that you will be able to read the documentation, and figure it out.

	On some systems, PDFTeX is set to output to A4 paper, even
though we have set the default to letterpaper.  This is sad, and can be
worked around.  If you are running Debian GNU/Linux, you should run
texconfig and change the PAPER option in the XDVI, DVIPS, DVIPDFM, and
PDFTEX settings.  Otherwise, find the "pdftex.cfg" file which usually
lives in /etc/texmf/pdftex/pdftex.cfg.  Make sure it has these two
lines:

    page_width 8.5 true in
    page_height 11 true in

You will want to comment out any other instances of page_width and
page_height by using the % character.
